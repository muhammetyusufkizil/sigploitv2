## Remediation Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Block port 3868 from public internet access
2. **Short-term:** Implement Diameter firewall (DEA/DRA)
3. **Long-term:** Deploy IPsec/TLS for Diameter interconnects
4. **Monitoring:** Implement logging for all Diameter connections

### Recommended Firewall Rules
```
# Block external Diameter access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3868 -s 0.0.0.0/0 -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3869 -s 0.0.0.0/0 -j DROP

# Allow only trusted peers
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3868 -s <TRUSTED_PEER_IP> -j ACCEPT
```
