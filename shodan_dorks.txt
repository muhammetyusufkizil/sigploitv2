# SHODAN DORKS FOR SS7 / SIGTRAN (TURKEY)

Finding an open SS7 gateway by random scanning is extremely difficult because they are rare and firewalled. 
Use these search queries on https://www.shodan.io/ to find devices that are ALREADY indexed.

### 1. Direct Port Search (SS7 / M3UA)
Find devices in Turkey with the specific SS7 over IP port open.
```text
port:2905 country:"TR"
port:2905 country:"TR" "SCTP"
port:2905 country:"TR" "M3UA"
```

### 2. SCTP Protocol (Transport Layer for SS7)
SS7 uses SCTP instead of TCP. Many scanners miss this.

Often, if 2905 is hidden, other management ports might be open nearby.
```text

port:138 (GTP-C) country:"TR"
port:2123 (GTP-C) country:"TR"
